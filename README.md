# Genomic-intron-mapping
tool to analyze and process intron datas

This repository contains a collection of R functions designed for analyzing and processing intron-related genomic data. The main scripts included in this repository are:

intron_analysis_utils.R: A set of utility functions for general intron analysis tasks, including data filtering, transformation, and summarization.

intron_merge_classify.R: A script that handles the merging and classification of intron data, aligning with the intron analysis requirements.

spliceGenome.R: Contains functions for working with genomic data and performing splice-site analysis.

These scripts are used in the VASP_devel package for R, which serves as a development toolset for variant annotation and splice site analysis. This repository provides the underlying functionality for those interested in genomic data processing and analysis within the VASP_devel framework.
